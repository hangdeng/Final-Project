# Final-Project: Please read me thanks!
Final Project for Modeling in earth&amp;environmental sciences
# 1) 
In the very first package of codes, I tried to simulate how subsidence and sediment supply affect the minibasin filling pattern. The very first version, I use diffusion model (diffusivity "googled" online) and parabolic subsidence curve to simulate the relationships between depositional surface and minibasin subsidence with linear dqdx plot. No erosion or compaction added.
# 2) 
In the second version of the first code package, I tried erosion proportinal to dqdx. No compaction added. I also make the Qs higher.

# 3)
Non deposition (no Qs) to increasing Qs in Qs curve

# 4) 
Working on river meandering code as proposed in the class
