# Final-Project: Please read me thanks!
Final Project for Modeling in earth&amp;environmental sciences
In the very first package of codes, I tried to simulate how subsidence and sediment supply affect the minibasin filling pattern. The very first version, I use diffusion model (diffusivity "googled" online) and parabolic subsidence curve to simulate the relationships between depositional surface and minibasin subsidence with linear dqdx plot. No erosion or compaction added.
